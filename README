                       cgit - cgi for git


This is an attempt to create a fast web interface for the git scm, using a
builtin cache to decrease server io-pressure.


Installation

$ $EDITOR Makefile
$ make
$ sudo make install

Note: cgit requires the git and xdiff libraries. Currently, the makefile
expects these files to be found in '../git/libgit.a' and '../git/xdiff/lib.a',
where they will be if you have built git from source in a parallell directory.


Runtime configuration

The file /etc/cgitrc is read by cgit before handling a request. A template 
cgitrc is shipped with the sources, and all parameters and default values 
can be found in this file.


The cache

When cgit is invoked it looks for a cachefile matching the request and 
returns it to the client. If no such cachefile exist (or if it has expired), 
the content for the request is written into the proper cachefile before the
file is returned.

If the cachefile has expired but cgit is unable to obtain a lock for it, the 
stale cachefile is returned to the client. This is done to favour page
throughput over page freshness.

The generated content contains the complete response to the client, including
the http-headers "Modified" and "Expires".
